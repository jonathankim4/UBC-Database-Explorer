HOW TO USE THE UI:

you will land the on mainpage where on the top sidebar there will be a menu option to select which of the 
menu option the user would like to select.

the user can either choose between courses, rooms, novelty, or deez.

when you go into a tab called courses, you will be redirected to a new page that contains on the options for the courses

you can choose a variety of options but mostly options that are user-friendly string entries or numbers into a search field
of any courses of interest. There are more options after the filtering options, specifically an option to order by a custom field
or to add special case queries that contain more details than just filtering on its own. The extra cases include most failing, most passing and avg grades along with an order option to complete a full exhaustive entry on the courses page.

from there on end you can choose the rooms explorer, more or less does the same thing as the courses page however it does not have an order option but instead gets distances between any buildings within the UBC area. It also has options to choose which rooms number or room name or seat size or furniture size options to filter by. Majority of the filtering is done on the one building specified by the dropdown in the beginning

The 3rd option is the shceduler, that schedules the courses and the rooms portion of the entire thing. Much like the previous two pages, you enter in some stuff and you get back a scheduler with all the time slots available to take those courses within those building distances.

The novelty explorer calls google maps API to just plot the routes between two buildings or it will just get the location of a single building on its own. It contains dropdowns of just start and end so its quite straightforward.
