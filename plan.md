REVISED BY JONATHAN KIM ON JANUARY 24/2017

Pushing my latest changed to addDataset where i was able to get the 
local file that is located in courses.zip to print out some of the zip
file content, however cannot get the parsing to work, still more todo

Added also a new test in InsightFacadeTest called adddataset to test out the print statements of the console.
